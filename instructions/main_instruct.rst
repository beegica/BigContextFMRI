Welcome to the Experiment!
==========================

You are tasked with studying a stream of pictures. Later during this task, you will
then be asked to view a list of images and to discriminate between which ones
you have not seen before and which ones you recognize from the study list.

We ask that you answer as quickly and as accuratly as you possibly can during
the experiment.

In between these tasks you will be asked to perform a brief math test, where you
are tasked with evaluating a math statement as True or False.

The whole task will take about 25 minutes and be followed by a few shorter
tasks that help us analyze our data better.

When you are ready to proceed to the study list, press any key on the Button
Box.

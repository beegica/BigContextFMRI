For this task you will be asked to attentively view a series of images in a
list. After a small distraction, you will be asked to view a second list and
determine whether the image on the screen is from a previous list, or if it is
an image you haven't seen before. You will do so by pressing one of two buttons
on the button box.
::

  Press the **LEFT** button to indicate that the image on the screen is an image you HAVE seen in the previous list.

::

  Press the **RIGHT** button to indicate that the image on the screen is an image you HAVEN'T seen in the previous list.

Remember to be as attentive as possible during the study list. You need to make
sure that you will be able to respond in the test list as quickly and accurately
as possible.

When you are ready to start experiment, press any button on the button box.

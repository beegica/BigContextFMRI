Testing Phase
=============

You will now go throw several runs of a recognition memory task. During this
task, you will be determining how strongly you recognize each presented image
as an image that was presented during the study list.

If you STRONGLY believe that a word is from the study list, Press the FAR LEFT BUTTON.

If you THINK that a word MIGHT be from the study list, Press the LEFT MIDDLE BUTTON.

If you THINK that a word MIGHT be a word you have never seen before, Press the RIGHT MIDDLE BUTTON.

If you STRONGLY believe the word is a word you have never seen before, Press the FAR RIGHT BUTTON.


Periodically during the task, we will stop the scanner to make sure you are okay.

When you are ready to begin the first Testing Block, press any button!

INSTRUCTIONS
============

You are about to see a series of images appear on the screen. They will come
at you in blocks of real objects and blocks of scrambled images. It is your
task to determine if the presented image is a repeat of the image that was one
image back.

    - When you see a repeated image, press ANY BUTTON on the button box.

An example : If you are presented an image of a Lolly-pop, and then presented
with another image of the same Lolly-pop, you press a button on the button box.
You do NOT press a button under any other circumstances. Please respond as
quickly and accurately as possible. You have until the next presentation of an
image to respond to an image.

When you are ready to begin, press ANY BUTTON on the button box.
